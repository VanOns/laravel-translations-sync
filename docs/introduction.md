# Introduction

Keeping translations in sync between your Laravel application and external tools can be a headache, especially when clients
want the flexibility to manage translations themselves. That is exactly why we built Laravel Translations Sync: to simplify
translation workflows and save time for everyone involved.

With this package, you can easily sync your app’s translation files with a provider like Google Sheets, making it straightforward
for clients to update translations without diving into code. It also takes care of translating missing keys automatically
using services like DeepL, so you are not left scrambling to fill in the gaps.

## Why Laravel Translations Sync?

* **Seamless syncing**: Keep your code and client-managed translations in perfect sync—no manual file updates needed.
* **Automatic translations**: Missing translations? Let DeepL or another provider handle it for you.
* **Built for collaboration**: Designed to make life easier for developers and clients alike by creating a workflow that works for both.

We created Laravel Translations Sync because we have been there: clients needed control over their translations, and we needed
a way to keep everything up to date without adding extra steps to our process. This package bridges that gap, letting you
focus on building great apps while keeping your translations organized and consistent.
